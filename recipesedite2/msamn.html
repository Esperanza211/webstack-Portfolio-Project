                        1/4 tsp dry yeast (less in very warm weather)
                        1/2 cup fine semolina (can use coarser caliber if you like)
                        1/4 cup very soft unsalted butter (more if needed).

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine the flour, yeast, and semolina in a large bowl.
            Add water: Gradually pour in 250ml (1 cup) of water while mixing the flour with the water using your hand or a mixer.
            Knead the dough: Knead the dough by hand or with a mixer and dough hook until it becomes smooth, soft, and elastic but not sticky. Adjust water or flour as needed.
            Rest the dough: Divide the dough into balls the size of small plums. Make sure the top and sides of the balls are smooth. Transfer the balls of dough to an oiled tray, cover loosely with plastic, and let rest for 10-15 minutes.
            Shape the dough: Generously oil your work surface and hands. Dip a ball of dough in oil and place it in the center of your work surface. Using a light touch and quick sweeping motion from the center outward, gently spread the dough into a paper-thin, roughly shaped circle. Oil your hands as needed.
            Laminate the dough: Dot the flattened dough with butter and sprinkle with semolina. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter to form an elongated rectangle. Dot again with butter, sprinkle with semolina, and fold again into thirds to form a square.
            Repeat the process: Repeat steps 5-6 with the remaining balls of dough. Keep track of the order in which you folded the squares.
            Cook the msemen: Heat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat until hot. Starting with the first msemen you folded, take a square of dough and place it on your oiled work surface. Oil your hands and pat the dough firmly to flatten it to double its original size. Transfer the flattened square to the hot griddle and cook, turning several times, until cooked through, crispy on the exterior, and golden in color. Repeat with the remaining squares, working with them in the order in which they were folded.
            Serve: Serve the msemen immediately, or allow to cool completely before freezing. To reheat, place frozen msemen directly on the rack in a preheated 350°F (180°C) oven or in a frying pan over medium-low heat.
            Tips and Variations:
            Use a mix of oil and melted butter for a richer flavor.
            Replace some or all of the white flour with whole wheat flour for added nutrition and flavor.
            Try using a mix of half white flour and half semolina for a coarser texture.
            Experiment with different fillings, such as butter, honey, jam, cheese, or savory ingredients like eggs or meat.
            For a more authentic Moroccan experience, serve with a cup of green mint tea or a sweet syrup made from butter and honey.
            Troubleshooting:
            If your msemen doesn’t have layers, check that you’ve laminated the dough properly and that your pan’s heat is not too high.
            If you’re having trouble getting the dough to rest, try letting it rest for a longer period or using a slower rising yeast.
            Enjoy your delicious Moroccan Msemen!
